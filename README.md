This repository maintains the resources used to complete my Master's Thesis on the topic of 'Human Reliability Estimation Using Psychophysiological
Behaviour: Electroencephalogram Based Brain Signal Analysis Approach', under the guidance of Professor Debasis Samanta at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.

Abstract:
===================
Human Reliability tells us the probability of conducting specific tasks by a subject with satisfactory performance. Due to the highly dynamic nature of human behaviour, estimating Human Reliability is a complex task. By using the Psycho-physiological behaviour of a human, estimating Human reliability can be accomplished. We have used brain electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to classify human behaviour on different levels of Performance Shaping Parameters. Our approach considers different human behaviour as different states and finds the probabilities of the errors made in these states using a Human Reliability Analysis Model called Person Specific Human Error Estimation.
